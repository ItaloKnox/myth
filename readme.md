> Due to a hardcoded feature in the game, the +18 resources won't load if you launch the game through Steam. Launching the game through the ``.exe`` will load the patch properly. I'm currently looking for a way of solving this issue.

This patch restores the content of MYTH, available on Steam.

## Buy the game

You can buy the game at [Steam (all-ages)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/366380/), and [MangaGamer (+18)](http://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?aflg=18over&product_code=195&af=5a1240455db09f0c4b161057e809ea0c).

## Installation

##### On Windows:
 1. [Download the master patch here](https://github.com/ItaloKnox/myth/archive/master.zip)
 2. Extract the file ``a.rpa`` and ``scenario.rpa`` inside ``.../SteamApps/common/MYTH/game``

##### On Linux or OSX:
 1. [Download the master patch here](https://github.com/ItaloKnox/myth/archive/master.zip)
 2. Extract the file ``a.rpa`` and ``scenario.rpa`` inside ``.../SteamApps/common/MYTH/game``

## FAQ

> How do I know if my game is properly patched?

When your open the game it should display a warning about adult content and the title should be only ``MYTH`` instead of MYTH ``(all ages)``

> How do I find my MYTH game folder?

Open your Steam library, choose the game from the list, **right click** on it and click on ``Properties``. Switch to the ``LOCAL FILES`` tab and click on ``Browse local files...``
After that, hold **shift** and **right click** on the folder ``game``, select "Copy as path``. Then paste the address in the installation box.

> **[Windows users]** The installer doesn't work on my system. Help!

See the section ["On Linux or OSX"](https://github.com/ItaloKnox/myth#on-linux-or-osx) and replicate the steps. It should also work on Windows.

> I don't see any +18 scenes yet, and I've been playing for hours!

MYTH is a very slow game and the amount of +18 are fairly small.
